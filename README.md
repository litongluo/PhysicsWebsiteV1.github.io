My Faraday's Law website can be accessed using the URL shown above. The six HTML webpages contain an introduction to the topic of EM induction, explaining Faraday's and Lenz's Laws. There are practice and challenge problems to follow up, as well as extra accredited (famous) lectures embedded from YouTube. I hope that this resource will be useful to all the first-year engineering and science students out there.

For those interested, LaTeX equations were rendered using the MathJax library and the 3D animation was made using SolidWorks Student Edition.
